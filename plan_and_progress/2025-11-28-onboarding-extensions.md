## Objective

Add three post–daily rhythm onboarding pages (joys, drains, why/focus selection) that match the provided reference while fitting the existing theme and atomic design layers.

## Plan

1. Review current onboarding flow and UI building blocks to match styling and navigation.
2. Build templates and supporting components for the new steps.
3. Wire new pages into the flow after daily rhythm and verify UX/order.

## Done Criteria

- New pages render with styling close to the reference and within the design system.
- Navigation progresses from daily rhythm through the new steps without dead ends.
- Basic accessibility (roles/labels) is present for interactive elements.

## Progress
