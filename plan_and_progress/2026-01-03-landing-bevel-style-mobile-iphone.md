## Objective

Make the landing page iPhone/features section match the “Bevel” mobile aesthetic: **headline/description above the phone + floating cards around the phone**, and remove the bottom “sheet” card. Keep **desktop unchanged**.

## Plan

1. Remove the mobile bottom sheet UI.
2. Add a mobile-only header above the phone and show a small set of floating cards around the phone with mobile-tuned positions.
3. Verify mobile + desktop.

## Done Criteria

- Mobile iPhone section feels like Bevel example (no bottom sheet; phone + floating cards; clean).
- Desktop layout unchanged.

## Progress

- 2026-01-03: Completed.

## Verification

- Manual QA at 375×667, 390×844, and 1440×1024.

## Outcomes

- Mobile iPhone/features section now keeps the full iPhone mock visible (no clipping), with a Bevel-style header and floating cards on mobile, while desktop remains unchanged.

## Follow-ups

- None.
