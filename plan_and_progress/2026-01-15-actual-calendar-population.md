- Status: In Progress

## Objective

Populate the calendar "actual" column using local screen time and location data,
merging into useful blocks that reflect planned vs actual behavior.

## Plan

1. Find existing mock data + actual block logic.
2. Implement block building from actual data sources.
3. Integrate with planned events to annotate actual blocks.

## Done Criteria

- Actual column renders merged blocks (>= 10 min) from data.
- Planned events are cross-referenced for category + distraction.
- Unassigned/unknown blocks appear for unplanned time.

## Progress

- 2026-01-15: Created plan and started discovery.
- 2026-01-15: Built actual-display derivation, merged evidence blocks, and wired calendar display.
- 2026-01-15: Added full-day unknown fill + Android usage-based screen blocks.

## Verification

- Not run yet.

## Outcomes

- Pending.

## Follow-ups

- Move to archive once complete.
