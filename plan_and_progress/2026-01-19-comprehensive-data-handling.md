 # Comprehensive Data Handling Enhancements
 
 - Status: In Progress
 - Owner: Codex
 - Started: 2026-01-19
 - Completed: -
 
 ## Objective
 
 Implement the full set of enhancements described in `docs/data-handling-enhancements-proposal.md`,
 prioritizing foundation improvements first while keeping the system stable and observable.
 
 ## Plan
 
 1. Phase 1 foundation: sleep analysis upgrades, app categorization, confidence metadata.
 2. Phase 2 intelligence: pattern learning, gap filling, transitions, evidence fusion.
 3. Phase 3 polish: verification reporting, real-time updates, data quality, personalization.
 4. Iterate in small, testable increments and validate against real device data.
 
 ## Done Criteria
 
 - All features listed in `docs/data-handling-enhancements-proposal.md` are implemented.
 - New data models are persisted with clear migration paths.
 - Derived events include confidence + evidence metadata.
 - QA confirms sleep, screen time, location, and workout handling behave as intended.
 
## Progress

- 2026-01-19: Added sleep quality metrics + refined actual adjust explanations; added learned-from metadata + normalized sleep override meta; added pattern-based gap suggestions; added commute transition + prep/wind-down detection; added evidence fusion conflict signals; added data quality + pattern anomaly signals; added granular verification timing statuses; added pattern summaries.
- 2026-01-19: Added app override learning, personalization preferences, and weighted corrections in pattern learning.
- 2026-01-19: Added evidence fusion weighting + verification reports; added anomaly detection + pattern insights UI; added personalization UI + preferences storage.
