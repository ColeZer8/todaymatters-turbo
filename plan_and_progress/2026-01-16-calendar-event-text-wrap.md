## Objective

Allow calendar event text to use more lines when the block has room.

## Plan

1. Adjust line limits for title/description based on block height.
2. Verify text no longer truncates on tall blocks.

## Done Criteria

- Event descriptions expand to multiple lines when space allows.
- Small/tiny blocks still keep compact text.

## Progress

- 2026-01-16: Expanded description line limits based on block height.

## Verification

- Not run yet.

## Outcomes

- Taller event blocks now render up to four description lines.

## Follow-ups

- None.
