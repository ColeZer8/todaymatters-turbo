- Status: In Progress

## Objective

Identify why actual events include "test" or wrong times and fix actual event derivation to use real data (screen time/location) with "unknown" when data is missing.

## Plan

1. Inspect actual event derivation and predictive/verification paths.
2. Correct data selection, filtering, and time grouping rules.
3. Validate against the reported screenshots and update logic.

## Done Criteria

- Actual events no longer include predictive/placeholder entries like "test".
- Actual timeline reflects screen time/location data or "unknown" when missing.
- Grouping/splitting aligns with real usage windows.

## Progress
