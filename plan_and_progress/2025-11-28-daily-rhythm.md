## Objective

Add the "Your daily rhythm" onboarding step after "Who are you?" so users can set wake and sleep times with a themed, native-feeling selector that matches the provided design.

## Plan

1. Review current onboarding flow, theme tokens, and atomic components to align styling and navigation.
2. Build a reusable daily rhythm template with time selection cards and a modal picker that fits the design.
3. Wire a new Expo Router screen into the flow after "Who are you?" and validate interactions.

## Done Criteria

- Screen visually aligns with the provided mock and Today Matters theme (colors, typography, spacing).
- Wake and sleep cards open a time selector and save the chosen time back to the screen state.
- Step indicator reflects Step 3 of 13; navigation continues the onboarding flow without regressions.
- No lint/type errors introduced by the new additions.

- 2025-11-28: Implemented the daily rhythm screen and switched the picker to the native-style spinner for a more Apple-like feel.
