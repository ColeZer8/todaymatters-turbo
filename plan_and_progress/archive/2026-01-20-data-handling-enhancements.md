## Objective

Complete remaining data-handling enhancements: pattern persistence and predictive planning, app override management UI, verification learning, real-time updates, and sleep analysis polish.

## Plan

1. Implement pattern persistence + predictive planning integration.
2. Add app override management UI and services.
3. Add verification learning and tunable thresholds.
4. Wire real-time updates and notifications.
5. Implement sleep polish (wake-time + deep/REM support).

## Done Criteria

- Patterns persist and load across sessions; predictive suggestions integrate into planning.
- Users can review/edit app overrides and categories.
- Verification thresholds configurable and used in scoring.
- Real-time evidence updates and notifications are functional.
- Sleep analysis includes wake-time and deep/REM support where available.

## Progress

- 2026-01-20: Implemented pattern persistence, app override UI, verification tuning, realtime updates, and sleep polish.

## Verification

- Not run (not requested).

## Outcomes

- Added persisted pattern storage, predictive planning suggestions, and realtime updates.
- Added app override management UI plus verification strictness settings.
- Expanded sleep metrics to include wake time and deep/REM when available.

## Follow-ups

- Deferred items or next steps
