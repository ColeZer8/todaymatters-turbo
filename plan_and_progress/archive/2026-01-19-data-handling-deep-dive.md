# Data Handling Deep Dive Status Update

- Status: Completed
- Owner: Codex
- Started: 2026-01-19
- Completed: 2026-01-19

## Objective

Deliver a thorough, code-backed deep dive on the data-handling enhancements status, aligning the current
implementation with `docs/data-handling-enhancements-proposal.md` and documenting gaps and next steps.

## Plan

1. Review current implementation files and map behavior to proposal phases.
2. Update the status doc with the verified flow, coverage, and gaps.
3. Log progress and verification notes.

## Done Criteria

- `docs/data-handling-enhancements-status.md` reflects the current pipeline and feature status.
- Gaps vs proposal are explicit and actionable.
- Status file notes where logic lives in the codebase.

## Progress

- 2026-01-19: Started deep dive and collected code references for the status update.
- 2026-01-19: Updated the status doc with pipeline flow, heuristics, and clarified gaps.

## Verification

- Not applicable (doc-only update).

## Outcomes

- Updated `docs/data-handling-enhancements-status.md` with the current pipeline and implementation gaps.

## Follow-ups

- Pending.
