## Objective

Ensure the daily calendar view renders the full time range without cutting off the bottom hours.

## Plan

1. Locate the calendar day view layout and height constraints.
2. Extend the scrollable area while keeping existing logic intact.
3. Verify visually or via quick run notes.

## Done Criteria

- Full calendar time range is visible without cutoff at the bottom.
- No changes to business logic or time calculations.

## Progress

- 2026-01-23: Tuned bottom padding to end right under the last event line while clearing the toolbar.

## Verification

- Not run (layout change only).

## Outcomes

- Balanced bottom padding so the full day renders without extra blank space.

## Follow-ups

- None.
