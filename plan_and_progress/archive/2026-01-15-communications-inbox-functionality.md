## Objective

Make the communications inbox functional with existing email data: mark as read/clear, show exact timestamps, and expose basic actions.

## Plan

1. Inspect current communications screen and data wiring.
2. Add read/clear state, timestamps, and actions while staying within current data model.
3. Validate UI updates and note any follow-ups.

## Done Criteria

- Users can mark a message as read (and it disappears from the list).
- Each message shows an exact time received.
- Basic actions are exposed for the current dataset.

## Progress

- 2026-01-15: Added mark-as-read actions, clear-all, and full timestamps for Gmail rows.

## Verification

- Not run (UI change only).

## Outcomes

- Added per-message and bulk read actions and exact timestamp display for Gmail entries.

## Follow-ups

- None.
