## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Turborepo monorepo with pnpm as package manager
- Quality checks available: `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run check-types`
- Pre-existing type errors may exist in the codebase - isolate your changes and commit only what's relevant to your story

## 2026-01-22 - Story 1
- **What was implemented:** Created a README.md file at the project root with the content "Hello Ralph"
- **Files changed:** README.md (created/replaced)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase may have pre-existing type errors unrelated to your work - don't let them block unrelated changes
  - Focus on committing only the files relevant to your user story
  - The root README.md previously existed but had different content (153 lines deleted)
