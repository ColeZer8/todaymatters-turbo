## Codebase Patterns
- Evidence data is fetched in `apps/mobile/src/lib/supabase/services/evidence-data.ts`
- Actual event derivation happens in `apps/mobile/src/lib/calendar/actual-display-events.ts`
- Screen time derivation is in `apps/mobile/src/lib/calendar/derive-screen-time-actual-events.ts`
- Calendar orchestration is in `apps/mobile/src/app/comprehensive-calendar.tsx`
- Rendering with absolute positioning is in `apps/mobile/src/components/templates/ComprehensiveCalendarTemplate.tsx`
- Known duplicate key issue at ComprehensiveCalendarTemplate.tsx lines 552-559

## Critical Issue - Android Physical Device
- **Problem**: Evidence data (location, screen time) not pulling on physical Android devices
- **Works**: Android simulator
- **Fails**: Physical Android device via Play Console internal testing (production build)
- **Permissions**: All granted (Usage Access, Location)
- **Symptom**: Nothing being pulled despite permissions granted
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - US-001 and US-002 must be completed first
